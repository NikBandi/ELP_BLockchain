# Git Onboarding

This folder contains materials for the Git workshop and collaboration setup phase.

Before we begin working on the blockchain projects, all members should complete the Git onboarding process.

## Workshop Goals

By the end of the workshop, you should be able to:

- Clone a repository
- Create a new branch
- Make edits to a file
- Commit changes
- Push your branch to GitHub
- Open a Pull Request
- Understand how merging works

## Workflow Overview

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a branch using your name
3. Edit `team_members.md`
4. Commit your changes
5. Push your branch
6. Open a Pull Request
7. Fill out the PR template

All practice work should stay inside this folder.

## Why This Matters

Version control allows us to:

- Work on multiple features safely
- Track changes over time
- Collaborate without overwriting each other's work
- Review code before merging
